  about:
    "👏Hi: Hi: Welcome to my website, at here i will briefly describe myself and projects that I have done.\n\nI am NTVinh, can call me a FrontEnd developer, my daily work is listen music, play game, read book, social , drink coffee with friends,... but also that i spend much time every day for coding, to me it is like a little hobby every time i have free time. I often find solutions and small ideas and then develop them into the finished products so i also gradually improved my web development skills. My future goal is to become a Fullstack Developer, my favorite programming language is JAVASCRIPT because it is really magic. \n\nThank you for reading this.",
